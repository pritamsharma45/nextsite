# Advanced Level: React Todo App

Master React with complex features, performance optimization, and professional patterns.

## What You'll Add

- Real-time synchronization
- Drag and drop functionality
- Undo/redo functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Advanced filtering and search
- Export/import functionality

## Professional Patterns

- **State Management**: Advanced state patterns with useReducer
- **Performance**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback optimization
- **Testing**: Unit and integration testing strategies
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced State Management

Learn how to manage complex application state using useReducer for predictable state updates and better debugging capabilities.

### 2. Performance Optimization

Implement React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize your application's performance.

### 3. Real-time Features

Add real-time synchronization capabilities that allow multiple users to collaborate on the same todo list.

### 4. Enhanced UX

Implement drag and drop functionality for reordering todos, keyboard shortcuts for power users, and undo/redo functionality.

### 5. Data Management

Add export/import functionality to backup and restore todo data in various formats (JSON, CSV).

## Architecture Concepts

This level focuses on professional React development patterns that you'll use in production applications:

- **Component composition** for better reusability
- **Custom hooks** for shared logic
- **Error boundaries** for graceful error handling
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization
- **Accessibility** best practices
