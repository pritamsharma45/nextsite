# Beginner Level: React Todo App

In this beginner level, you'll learn how to build a React todo app from scratch.

## What You'll Build

A web application that:

- Displays a list of todos
- Allows adding new todos
- Marks todos as complete/incomplete
- Deletes todos

## Key Concepts

- **React Components**: Learn how to create and structure React components
- **State Management**: Understand useState hook for managing component state
- **Event Handling**: Handle user interactions like clicks and form submissions
- **Props**: Pass data between parent and child components

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Component Structure

Understand how React applications are built using reusable components and how to organize your code effectively.

### 2. State Management

Learn the useState hook to manage dynamic data in your application and understand when and how state updates trigger re-renders.

### 3. Event Handling

Master handling user interactions such as form submissions, button clicks, and input changes in a React-friendly way.

### 4. Props and Data Flow

Understand how data flows down through props and how child components can communicate back to parents through callback functions.

### 5. Conditional Rendering

Learn how to conditionally show or hide elements based on application state and user interactions.

## Core Skills Covered

- **JSX**: Writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- **Components**: Creating functional components
- **useState**: Managing local component state
- **Event Handlers**: onClick, onChange, onSubmit
- **Array Methods**: map, filter for rendering lists
- **Forms**: Controlled inputs and form validation
