## Overview

In this article I will show you how to send email to the users who are registering for an event via [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBBBhCw7meYlKA-bQS_iHb5s0O04pwvQvnmLP-aRpHTAY7eA/viewform).Upon successfull registration, the user will receive email with unique registration number and an unique QR code. The [associated response](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPWXmZdtuviZCHLdeyTGBjgfqvepaHiD6oS3ydmiQcI/edit#gid=1287886429) sheet will also record their registration number along with their email IDs.
This QR code will later be scanned at the event to record their attendance using our [QR code scanning app](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxvAYXxukX53GqpGnSRqFbl1h-xUjtHPdjal6sleyHQkZ56wkbvA_DrA71zZ4AtDlU/exec).
