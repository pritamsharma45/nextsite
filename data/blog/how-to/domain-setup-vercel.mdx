When you deploy your site on Vercel, you get automatically fancy domain like nextsite-pritamsharma45.vercel.app.
But when you want to add domain, sometimes you need to look around and explore the steps that needs to be followed.
So, I thought to pen down the process to save your sometime.

[X] Set up on Vercel side - Head to Vercel Dashboard - Go to settings tab - Select Domains - Add your site domain
After adding you will see some warning ##IMAGE## . This will be removed after you have done minor setup on Namecheap account.

[X] Setup on Namecheap account

    - Login to your Namecheap account.
    - Click on Domain List appearing on the sidebar.
    - Now choose the Domain you want to add.
    - Click Manage
    - Now from the Nameservers section click on the dropdown and select Custom DNS.
    - Now paste the Vercels' DNS addresses copied during Vecrel project setup procedures.
    - Click on the green check mark to save it.
    - Done! It would take some time. Visit your newly added domain after 10-20 minutes. It should be live by then.
